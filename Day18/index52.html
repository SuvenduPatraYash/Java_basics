<h2>Dog's Symbol</h2>
<p>Dogs are often referred to as “man’s best friend.” They are amongst the most beloved animals in the world, and have had important relationships with humanity since the dawn of civilization. The symbolism of the dog is associated with unconditional love and loyalty. Due to their closeness with humans and their uniquely social natures, dogs are rich with spiritual meaning and appear in a number of myths and traditions.</p>

	<h4>Street Dogs</h4>
<p>Street dogs, known in scientific literature as free-ranging urban dogs,are unconfined dogs that live in cities. They live virtually everywhere where cities exist and the local human population allows, especially in the developing world and the former USSR. Street dogs may be stray dogs, pets which have strayed from or are abandoned by their owners, or may be feral animals that have never been owned. Street dogs may be stray purebreds, true mixed-breed dogs, or unbred landraces such as the dog. Street dog overpopulation can cause problems for the societies in which they live, so campaigns to spay and neuter them are sometimes implemented. They tend to differ from rural free-ranging dogs in their skill sets, socialization, and ecological effects.</p>
